Hi! My name is Mathieu Bray and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) of the [University of Michigan School of Public Health](https://www.sph.umich.edu/), as well as a Research Assistant at the [U-M Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center](http://kecc.sph.umich.edu/). I achieved candidacy in May of 2015, and am currently working on my dissertation under the supervision of [Dr. Peter X-K Song](http://www.umich.edu/~songlab/). I previously obtained my B.Sc. (Joint Honours in Statistics and Computer Science) in 2012 from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca).

My research interests center primarily around network analysis, including multilayer networks, dynamic networks, patient transfer networks and social networks. In particular, my main focus is in kidney exchange networks, also known as [Kidney Paired Donation](http://kecc.sph.umich.edu/projects/optimization-and-simulation-kidney-paired-donation-program). Other research interests include bandit problems, supervised and regularized dimension reduction, non-negative matrix factorization, and online algorithms.

I am an avid hockey fan and player, and occasionally dabble in hockey statistics.
